# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

### Another use for this type of layout is to document archival data in a flashcard-like format to create something similar to a catalogue. Each card can contain a picture and some brief information on a piece in an archive. This website will allow historians to easily flip through the contents of an archive to narrow down what pieces they would be interested in taking a closer look at. This website will also ensure that historians will know exactly what they want to study even before they enter the archive. This system may also help prevent delays in the research process, as historians will know what they need and will know where they need it from before visiting the physical archive. 

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

### The researcher, as the figure controlling the final project, its distribution, and final edits, has the main responsibility to protect the data they have access too. This is especially important when considering the information the participants have chosen to keep hidden. Furthermore, the participants only have the right to the data they have provided and not the full project. As it is their intellectual property, they have the right to make decisions on what this data will be used for unless they give the researcher full permission to share their data. The researcher is also obligated to clearly inform the participants of where their information will be shared. Unless they have signed away this right, the participants also have the right to leave the project and ask that their information be deleted.


## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

### The use I described above was a digital archive catalogue. Within this use, each piece in the archive would be on its own individual card. This card would need to contain fields such as the piece’s name, material, date published/made, date it entered the archive, origin, author/publisher, and a brief description of the piece’s content. However, this kind of data structure, while concise and informative does have its limitations. It is very likely that the condensed nature of the information presented may not give the historian the information they need to make a decision about the archival piece as the information provided is restricted to those fields. While doing research, the historian may inevitably have to visit the archive and search manually. If this is the case, the time they have spent looking at the website may actually have delayed the project. However, the process of historical research and data collection is by nature very specific to the project and this website cannot anticipate the precise needs of the historian.
